        Hyperloop is the first new major mode of transportation in 100 years.
        It's designed to be safe, energy efficient, and reliable. It will take you
        directly to your destination at speeds of up to 700mph, above land or underground.

          We have developed a proprietary electric propulsion system which was tested first 
          in May 2016 in an open-air propulsion test, in May 2017 in our first full-systems 
          test, and again in July 2017 during our Phase 2 testing.

      <p class="lm2vidB">
        A global economy requires faster, cheaper and more efficient transportation models.
        Our roads, airports and ports are congested. We haven't had a major new form of 
        transportation in 100 years, and we're due for one, especially one that is ultra-fast,
        on-demand, direct, emmission-free, energy efficient, and has a smaller footprint  than other
        high-speed transport models.

          There are four key differences. It's faster, as in two or three times fater than the
          fastest high-speed rail. It's on demand and direct. Trains follow a schedule and
          typically have multiple stops. Hyperloop leaves when you're ready to go, and pods can 
          depart up to several times per minute and can transport passengers and cargo direct to 
          their destination with no stops along the way. It's environmentally friendly with a smaller
          civil engineering footprint, more efficient energy consumption and no direct emmissions or
          noise. It's less expensive and different technology. High-speed rails and maglev-trains 
          require power along the entire track. As a result the track costs more to build and more to 
          operate. Hyperloop One achieves better performance for a lower cost.
