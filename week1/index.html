            <div id="hyp">Hyperloop is the first new major mode of transportation in 100 years. It's designed to be safe
                , energy efficient and reliable. It will take you directly to your destination at speeds of upto 700
                mph, above land or underground.</div>

            <div id="real">We have developed a proprietory electric propulsion system which was tested first in May 2016
                in an open air propulsion test,in May 2017 in our first full systems test, and again in July 2017 during
                our Phase 2 testing. </div>

        <div id="need"> A growing global economy requires faster,cheaper , safer and more efficient transportation
            modes.Our roads,airports and ports are congested.We haven't had a major new form of transport in 100 years,
            and we're due for one that is ultra fast,on-demand,direct,emission-free,energy efficient,quiet and has a
            smaller footprint than other high-speed transport modes. </div>
